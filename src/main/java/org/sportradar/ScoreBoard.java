/**
 * The Live Football World Cup Score Board.
 *
 * <h1>Read/Write ratio
 * <p>The 2026 World Cup will see <b>48 teams</b> competing.
 * With a nature of Football (goals per game) and a number of parallel games
 * it's expected that <b>Write rate is very small with very low concurrency</b>.
 *
 * <p>While lots of watchers (software clients in term) are expected
 * meaning <b>very high Read rate and very high concurrency</b>.
 *
 * To favor Read operations as a basic access pattern,
 * {@code TreeSet} has been chosen with immutable {@code Match} entities.
 * What allows to give a live (low-latency) summary of WorldCup with already ordered set,
 * but with slower Write ops as a tradeoff (but Write ops are rare with slow concurrency).
 *
 * <p>
 * todo list:
 * - provide javadoc
 * - consider to separate Read & Write operations (CQSR) to decouple: Start, Update, Finish vs Summary
 * - consider 3-rd party lib for validation
